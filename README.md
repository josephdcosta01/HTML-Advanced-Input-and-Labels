Input
You should know that there are two different types of inputs.

Single-line, basically an input, you see them in website when you have to enter your login for example. Multiline, that one is used to enter larger text, an example that you might see are the object part of a contact us page when you want to write a message. the big white box when you can jump to the line mostly.

Single-line input
We use the tag <input/>. Good thing for us this tag is used for most of the inputs that exists in Web development. This tag in an inline tag is where the structure of the form become important.

Mostly when doing an input the game is to remember all the different values of the attribute type. But this is not enough. You have to link the label to the textbox. Maybe some of you knows that when you click on an input automatically it gives the focus to the input. Itâ€™s a nice feature that simplifies the life of users.

First you need to add a new attribute to your input ( and you know that one already): id
The id attribute is only here to do that focus feature with the input, nothing else.
To recap. Attribute name will be for our backend as a marker, attribute id is here to link the label you created to his specific attribute.
